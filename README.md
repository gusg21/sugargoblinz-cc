# Chess-Competition

This is a C++ chess competition base repository. Here we are going to host only the chess engine part of the competition. The competition will be held on a web platform, and the source code will be available on a different repository.

## Main activity

You have to code a chess engine from the ground up. You will receive a string as input following [FEN](https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess) notation and the output should be the move as [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface). 

## Rules

- Implement your chess engine only inside the chess-bot folder in C++;
- Create .h and .cpp files inside chess-bot;
- Obey the interface specified on chess-bot;
- You might want to test your code via terminal via chess-cli, or chess-gui;
- Merge requests are welcome;
- When you submit your code, you should zip only the contents of the chess-bot folder and send it to the system;
- Do not use sub-folders inside the chess-bot folder, it will break my automation;

## Folder structure

- chess-bot: Here you will implement your chess engine;
- chess-validator: Here you will find the chess-validator code;
- chess-gui: Here you will find the chess-gui code;

## How the competition will work
